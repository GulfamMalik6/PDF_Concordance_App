# PDF_Concordance_App
This project is a PDF Concordance Generator built with Flask and Python. It extracts words from a PDF and creates a concordance, showing the pages where each word appears. Users can search for words and view their occurrences and definitions using NLTK, with results displayed in a simple web interface.
